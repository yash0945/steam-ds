## Fairness

- Ensure dataset is diverse and unbiased.
- Evaluate model predictions for disparate impact.
- Regularly test for bias across different demographic groups.

## Transparency

- Document model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics.
- Provide explanations for predictions where possible.
- Maintain clear versioning of datasets and models.

## Privacy

- Anonymize sensitive data before training.
- Follow GDPR, HIPAA, or other relevant regulations.
- Limit access to personal data and maintain data security.

## Accountability

- Assign clear responsibility for model outcomes.
- Maintain audit logs for model predictions and decisions.
- Implement procedures to address errors or unintended consequences.

## Safety

- Evaluate models for potential harm before deployment.
- Monitor model performance in production to detect failures.
- Include fail-safes and fallback mechanisms in critical applications.

## Environmental Impact

- Optimize model training to reduce energy consumption.
- Prefer lightweight models where possible.
- Monitor and report carbon footprint for large-scale model training.
